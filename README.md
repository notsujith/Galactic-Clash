# Galactic Clash

**Galactic Clash** is a competitive two-player game developed using Python and Pygame. This space-themed arcade game pits two players against each other, each controlling a spaceship on opposite sides of a central barrier. The goal is to maneuver their spaceship to avoid incoming bullets while trying to shoot down the opponent's spaceship.

## Features

- **2D Graphics**: Utilizes Pygame to render spaceships, bullets, and the game environment dynamically.
- **Player Controls**: 
  - Player 1 uses `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` for movement and `Tab` to shoot.
  - Player 2 uses the Arrow keys for movement and `Spacebar` to shoot.
- **Bullet Mechanics**: Limited number of bullets can be on screen at a time, with direct hits decreasing opponent's health.
- **Health System**: Each ship has a health meter; game ends when one ship's health depletes.
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for shooting and hits to enhance gameplay experience.
- **End Game Scenario**: A victory message is displayed indicating the winner, followed by a game reset for a new round.
